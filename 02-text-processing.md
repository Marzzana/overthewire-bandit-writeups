## Level 7 - Searching Within a File

The home directory contained a file called `data.txt` with a massive amount of text. The password was stored on the line next to the word "millionth".
```bash
grep millionth data.txt
```

The `grep` command searches for a specific string inside a file and outputs the matching line. Password revealed.

**Key concepts:** Using `grep` to search for text within files.
